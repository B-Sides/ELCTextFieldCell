****** HOW TO USE ******

This UITableViewCell subclass is most commonly used for the creation of forms. There is a leftLabel and a rightTextField in each cell. You should configure the labels text and the textfields placeholder appropriately. The cell defines a protocol called ELCTextFieldDelegate which has 6 optional methods. 

The two most used are:

//Called to the delegate whenever the text in the rightTextField is changed
- (void)textFieldCell:(ELCTextFieldCell *)inCell updateTextLabelAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)inIndexPath string:(NSString *)inValue;

//Called to the delegate whenever return is hit when a user is typing into the rightTextField of an ELCTextFieldCell
- (BOOL)textFieldCell:(ELCTextFieldCell *)inCell shouldReturnForIndexPath:(NSIndexPath*)inIndexPath withValue:(NSString *)inValue;

The other four just forward on the UITextFieldDelegate methods, if the ELCTextFieldCellDelegate implements them.
- (BOOL)textFieldShouldBeginEditing:(UITextField *)textField;
- (BOOL)textFieldShouldEndEditing:(UITextField *)textField;
- (void)textFieldDidBeginEditing:(UITextField *)textField;
- (void)textFieldDidEndEditing:(UITextField *)textField;
